      <header>What is Dungeons & Dragons?</header>

      <p>Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a legendary tabletop role-playing game that has been bringing friends together for over 40 years. At its core, it’s a collaborative storytelling experience where players and a Dungeon Master (DM) create a world filled with adventure, magic, and danger.</p>

      <h1>Core Concepts:</h1>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Role-Playing:</b> You take on the persona of a character you create, complete with their backstory, personality, and goals.</li>
        <li><b>Dice Rolls:</b> Success and failure are determined by rolling dice, adding a layer of unpredictability to the story.</li>
        <li><b>Shared Narrative:</b> Unlike video games, there’s no pre-written script. The story unfolds based on the choices made by the players and DM.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>D&D isn’t just a game; it’s an escape. Players can become a daring rogue stealing from the rich, a powerful wizard seeking forbidden knowledge, or even a bard trying to charm a dragon. The possibilities are endless!</p>

      <header>Creating Your Character</header>

      <p>Making your character is where the fun begins. Think of it as crafting your alter ego, someone who can take on the challenges of a fantastical world.</p>

      <h1>Step 1: Choose a Race</h1>

      <p>Each race in D&D offers unique traits. For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Elves:</b> Graceful, long-lived, and often attuned to magic.</li>
        <li><b>Dwarves:</b> Sturdy, hardy, and masters of crafting.</li>
        <li><b>Tieflings:</b> Descendants of demons, marked by horns and a fiery spirit.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Step 2: Choose a Class</h1>

      <p>Your class defines your role in the party. For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Fighter:</b> A versatile combatant.</li>
        <li><b>Wizard:</b> Master of arcane spells.</li>
        <li><b>Rogue:</b> Skilled in stealth and subterfuge.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Step 3: Assign Ability Scores</h1>

      <p>Distribute points to your stats (Strength, Dexterity, etc.) based on your character’s personality and abilities. A brawny barbarian might max out Strength, while a cunning rogue prioritizes Dexterity.</p>

      <p><b>Example:</b></p>

      <p><i>"I made a Half-Orc Bard named Thrum. He’s loud, plays the drums, and uses his charisma to solve most problems—when he isn’t hitting things with his war drum."</i></p>

      <code>
        <p>STR: 15 | DEX: 12 | CON: 14 | INT: 8 | WIS: 10 | CHA: 16</p>
      </code>

    <section class="main-section" id="How_Combat_Works">
      <header>How Combat Works</header>

      <p>Combat in D&D is like a strategic dance of dice and decisions. It’s fast-paced, chaotic, and thrilling!</p>

      <h1>The Basics:</h1>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Turn Order:</b> Determined by an initiative roll (d20 + Dexterity modifier).</li>
        <li><b>Your Turn:</b> Players can move, take an action (like attacking), and use a bonus action if applicable.</li>
        <li><b>Enemy’s Turn:</b> The DM controls enemies, adding suspense to the battlefield.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Damage Mechanics:</h1>

      <p>Weapons and spells deal specific damage based on dice rolls. For example:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A longsword deals <i>1d8</i> damage.</li>
      </ul>

      <code>
        <pre>
          Roll to hit: d20 = 18 (Success!)
          Damage: Longsword, d8 = 5
          Goblin HP: 0 (Defeated!)
        </pre>
      </code>

      <ul>
        <li>The Fireball spell deals <i>8d6</i> damage, lighting up the battlefield!</li>
      </ul>

      <code>
        <pre>
          Player: "I cast Fireball at the group of goblins."
          DM: "Roll 8d6 for damage."
          Player: Rolls 8d6 = [5, 3, 6, 2, 4, 6, 5, 1] = 32 total
          DM: "The goblins are incinerated in a fiery explosion!"
        </pre>
      </code>

    <section class="main-section" id="The_Role_of_the_Dungeon_Master_(DM)">
      <header>The Role of the Dungeon Master (DM)</header>

      <p>The Dungeon Master is the backbone of any D&D game. They don’t play a single character; they play <i>everything else</i>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Worldbuilding Mastermind:</b> The DM creates the world, from its sprawling cities to its darkest dungeons. They bring NPCs to life, describe the scenery, and make every encounter feel real.</li>
        <li><b>Arbiter of Rules:</b> They interpret the game’s rules, ensuring fairness while keeping the story moving. The best DMs know when to stick to the rules and when to bend them for the sake of fun.</li>
      </ul>

      <header>Essential Dice and What They’re For</header>

      <p>D&D wouldn’t be the same without its iconic polyhedral dice. Each die serves a specific purpose, adding an element of luck to the game.</p>

      <h1>The Dice Set:</h1>

      <ul>
        <li><b>d20:</b> The most-used die, for attacks, skill checks, and saves.</li>
      </ul>

      <code>
        <pre>
          DM: "Roll a Stealth check to sneak past the guard."
          Player: Rolls d20 = 14 + Stealth bonus (+3) = 17
          DM: "The guard doesn’t notice you. You slip by undetected."
        </pre>
      </code>

      <ul>
        <li><b>d8, d10, d12:</b> Deal heavier damage with weapons or spells.</li>
        <li><b>d6:</b> Used for smaller damage rolls or healing spells.</li>
        <li><b>d4:</b> For minor effects like potions or Magic Missile.</li>
        <li><b>d100:</b> Used for random chance events or loot tables.</li>
      </ul>

      <code>
        <p>Tip: Roll high, and the dice gods smile upon you!</p>
